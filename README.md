The project was developed in a course held by the Data Science Academy: https://www.datascienceacademy.com.br.

The data used in the project are available at the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nosbielcs/brazilian-delivery-center

The goal of project is develop skills of do analises using SQL language. The project was developed in the MySQL DBMS, where the data was loaded and the questions below were answered later:

2- What is the number of requests (orders) per status?

3- What is the number of stores per hub city?

4- What is the highest and lowest payment amount (payment_amount) registered?

5- What type of driver (driver_type) made the most deliveries?

6- What is the average distance of deliveries by type of driver (driver_modal)?

7- What is the average order value (order_amount) per store, in descending order?

8- Are there orders that are not associated with stores? If so, how many?

9- What is the total order value (order_amount) in channel 'FOOD PLACE'?

10- How many payments were canceled (chargeback)?

11- What was the average amount of canceled payments (chargeback)?

12- What is the average payment amount per payment method (payment_method) in descending order?

13- Which payment methods had an average value greater than 100?

14- What is the average order value (order_amount) per hub state (hub_state), store segment (store_segment) and channel type (channel_type)?

15- Which hub state (hub_state), store segment (store_segment) and channel type (channel_type) had an average order value (order_amount) greater than 450?

16- What is the total order amount (order_amount) per hub state (hub_state), store segment (store_segment) and channel type (channel_type)? Show intermediate totals and format the result.
